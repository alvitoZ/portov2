        <h2>Who is Kita?</h2>
        <p>
          For the blind, she is vision. For the hungry, she is the chef. For the
          thirsty, she is water. If Kita thinks, I agree. If Kita speaks, Iâ€™m
          listening. If Kita has a million fans, I am one of them. If Kita has
          ten fans, I am one of them. If Kita has only one fan, that is me. If
          Kita has no fans, I no longer exist. If the whole world is against
          Kita , I am against the whole world. I will love Kita until my very
          last breath.
